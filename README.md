# TypeScript Analyzer

**TypeScript Analyzer** is a C# tool that extracts and analyzes structural elements from TypeScript source code — including functions, class methods, arrow functions, and more. It is designed for static code analysis, documentation generation, or code transformation tools.

## Features

- Extracts global and class-based functions
- Supports `async`, generator (`*`), and arrow functions
- Captures full method bodies and parameter lists
- Groups methods by class name
- Written in C# – fast and easy to integrate
- Future-proof for support of:
  - Interfaces, enums, types
  - Decorators and comments
  - Import/export declarations

## Installation

Clone the repository and build the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andikatjacobdennis/typescript-analyzer.git
cd typescript-analyzer
dotnet build
```

## Usage

Place a `.ts` file in the project folder (or specify a path), then run:

```bash
dotnet run --project TypeScriptAnalyzer.csproj
```

Edit `Program.cs` to point to your TypeScript file:

```csharp
string filePath = "sample.ts";
```

## Sample Output

```
=== Global Functions ===
Name: outside
Params: (msg: string)
ReturnType: void
...

=== Class Methods === Class: Calculator ---
Name: add
Params: (a: number, b: number)
ReturnType: number
...
```
